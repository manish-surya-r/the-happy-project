# Chapter 1.1: The World is Made of Objects

## Everything is an Object!

Look around you right now. What do you see? Maybe:

- Your smartphone
- A book
- A chair
- A water bottle

Each of these things is an **object**. They have:

1. **Properties** (what they ARE - color, size, weight)
2. **Behaviors** (what they CAN DO - ring, open, support weight, hold water)

## Your School as a Software Model

Let's imagine we're building a School Management System. How would we organize it?

### The Messy Way (Without Objects)

```pseudo
# Spaghetti Code - Everything mixed together!
student1_name = "Alex"
student1_age = 15
student1_grade = "10th"
student1_subjects = ["Math", "Science"]

student2_name = "Bella"
student2_age = 16
student2_grade = "11th"
student2_subjects = ["History", "Art"]

# Functions everywhere!
def calculate_average(student_name):
    # Find the right student... but how?
    # Check student1_name? student2_name?
    # This gets messy quickly!
```

**Problem:** What happens when we have 1000 students? 100 teachers? 50 classrooms? It becomes a nightmare to manage!

### The Organized Way (With Objects)

```pseudo
# First, define a BLUEPRINT (Class)
CLASS Student:
    # Properties (Attributes)
    name
    age
    grade
    subjects
    attendance

    # Behaviors (Methods)
    METHOD attend_class(class_name)
    METHOD submit_assignment(assignment)
    METHOD calculate_average()
    METHOD promote_to_next_grade()

# Now create actual Students (Objects)
alex = NEW Student()
alex.name = "Alex"
alex.age = 15
alex.grade = "10th"

bella = NEW Student()
bella.name = "Bella"
bella.age = 16
bella.grade = "11th"
```

## Two Key Concepts: Classes and Objects

### Class = Blueprint

| Real-World Blueprint | Software Class      |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| House blueprint      | Student class       |
| Car design 图纸      | BankAccount class   |
| Recipe               | GameCharacter class |

**Class Definition:** A template or blueprint that describes what properties and behaviors objects of that type will have.

```pseudo
# Class = Blueprint
CLASS Car:
    properties: color, brand, speed, fuel
    behaviors: accelerate(), brake(), honk()

# This is just a blueprint. No actual car exists yet!
```

### Object = Actual Instance

| Real-World Instance | Software Object      |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Your specific house | alex object          |
| Your friend's car   | myBankAccount object |
| Pizza from recipe   | player1 object       |

**Object Definition:** An actual, concrete instance created from a class blueprint.

```pseudo
# Creating Objects (Instances) from the Class
my_car = NEW Car()           # One actual car
my_car.color = "Red"
my_car.brand = "Toyota"

friends_car = NEW Car()      # Another actual car
friends_car.color = "Blue"
friends_car.brand = "Honda"

# Each is independent!
my_car.accelerate()  # Only my car speeds up
```

## Video Game Example

Let's build a simple game to understand better:

```pseudo
# Blueprint for ALL game characters
CLASS GameCharacter:
    # Properties (State)
    name
    health
    level
    position_x
    position_y

    # Behaviors (Methods)
    METHOD move(direction, distance)
    METHOD attack(target)
    METHOD take_damage(amount)
    METHOD heal(amount)

# Create actual characters
hero = NEW GameCharacter()
hero.name = "Aragon"
hero.health = 100
hero.level = 5

villain = NEW GameCharacter()
villain.name = "Dark Lord"
villain.health = 150
villain.level = 8

# They can act independently
hero.move("north", 10)
villain.attack(hero)
```

## Why Do We Need Classes and Objects?

### Problem: Managing Complexity

Imagine these scenarios WITHOUT objects:

| Scenario                       | Without Objects                                   | With Objects                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **School with 1000 students**  | 1000 variables for names, 1000 for ages... Chaos! | One `Student` class, 1000 `Student` objects  |
| **Online store with products** | Product1_name, Product1_price, Product2_name...   | One `Product` class, many `Product` objects  |
| **Social media with users**    | User1_posts, User1_friends, User2_posts...        | One `User` class, millions of `User` objects |

### The "Aha!" Moment

**Before OOD (Procedural Thinking):**

```
"I need to write steps:
1. Get student name
2. Get student age
3. Calculate average
4. Print result
```

**After OOD (Object Thinking):**

```
"I have Students. Each Student can:
- Store their own data
- Calculate their own average
- Print their own report

The Student KNOWS how to do Student things!"
```

## Building Our School System

Let's design a complete (but simple) school system:

```pseudo
# Blueprint for a Person (very general)
CLASS Person:
    name
    age
    email

    METHOD introduce()
        PRINT "Hi, I'm " + name

# Blueprint for Student (specific type of Person)
CLASS Student EXTENDS Person:  # We'll learn "extends" later!
    student_id
    grade
    subjects = []

    METHOD enroll(subject)
        ADD subject TO subjects
        PRINT name + " enrolled in " + subject

    METHOD study()
        PRINT name + " is studying"

# Blueprint for Teacher
CLASS Teacher EXTENDS Person:
    teacher_id
    department
    subjects_taught = []

    METHOD teach(class_name)
        PRINT name + " is teaching " + class_name

    METHOD grade_assignment(student, score)
        PRINT "Graded " + student.name + ": " + score

# Now let's use our system!
mr_smith = NEW Teacher()
mr_smith.name = "Mr. Smith"
mr_smith.department = "Science"

alex = NEW Student()
alex.name = "Alex"
alex.grade = "10th"

# They can interact
mr_smith.teach("Biology")
alex.enroll("Biology")
alex.study()
mr_smith.grade_assignment(alex, "A+")
```

## Spot the Objects! (Thinking Exercise)

Look at these everyday things. Can you identify:

1. What CLASS they might belong to?
2. What PROPERTIES they have?
3. What BEHAVIORS they can do?

| Thing             | Possible Class | Properties                          | Behaviors                        |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Smartphone**    | `MobileDevice` | brand, model, battery%, storage     | call(), text(), take_photo()     |
| **Library Book**  | `Book`         | title, author, ISBN, is_checked_out | check_out(), return(), renew()   |
| **YouTube Video** | `Video`        | title, uploader, duration, views    | play(), pause(), like(), share() |
| **Your Backpack** | `Bag`          | color, capacity, weight             | open(), close(), add_item()      |

**Your Turn:** Pick three things around you and fill this table!

## Key Takeaways

1. **The world is made of objects** - everything has properties and behaviors
2. **Class = Blueprint** - defines what objects of that type will be like
3. **Object = Instance** - actual thing created from the blueprint
4. **Why we need this:**
   - Organizes complex systems
   - Models real-world relationships
   - Makes code reusable and maintainable
   - Mirrors how we naturally think!

## Quick Check

**Question 1:** Is "Vehicle" a class or an object?
**Answer:** Class (it's a blueprint for cars, bikes, trucks...)

**Question 2:** Is "My red Toyota car" a class or an object?
**Answer:** Object (it's an actual instance)

**Question 3:** What would be properties of a `SocialMediaPost` class?
**Possible Answer:** content, author, likes_count, timestamp

**Question 4:** What would be behaviors of a `SocialMediaPost` class?
**Possible Answer:** like(), share(), comment(), edit()

## Practice Exercise

Design a `Pet` class for a pet management app:

1. What properties should a Pet have? (at least 4)
2. What behaviors should a Pet be able to do? (at least 3)
3. Write pseudo-code for your Pet class
4. Create two pet objects from your class

**Example Starter:**

```pseudo
CLASS Pet:
    # Your properties here

    # Your methods here
```

> **Remember:** You already think in objects every day. Now you're just learning to translate that thinking into code design!
